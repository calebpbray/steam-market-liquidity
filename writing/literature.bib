  abstract = {This paper uses hedonic pricing to empirically estimate the value of publicly provided local goods and services in the constituencies of the ruling party relative to those of the opposition parties. To improve control for omitted variables that change smoothly over space, we use a regression discontinuity design to restrict the sample to houses that are near the electoral boundaries. Using resale market prices of public flats in Singapore, in some cases we find a moderate but highly statistically significant difference in housing prices across the electoral boundaries that separate the constituencies of the ruling party and the opposition parties.},

  abstract = {Cross-sectional estimates of hedonic price functions theoretically recover marginal values for characteristics but face endogeneity problems. Consequently, economists have introduced difference-in-differences and other quasi-experimental econometric methods into hedonic models. Unfortunately, the welfare interpretation of these estimands has not been clear. This paper shows that quasi-experimental hedonics can identify the movement along the ex post price function. It further shows that this effect is a lower bound on general equilibrium welfare. Thus, nonmarginal welfare can be recovered using transparent designs without Rosen’s second stage or more structural models. The paper illustrates these results with an application to toxic facilities and housing prices.},

  abstract  = {Recent empirical work in several economic fields, particularly environmental and energy economics, has adapted the regression discontinuity (RD) framework to applications where time is the running variable and treatment begins at a particular threshold in time. In this guide for practitioners, we discuss several features of this regression discontinuity in time framework that differ from the more standard cross-sectional RD framework. First, many applications (particularly in environmental economics) lack cross-sectional variation and are estimated using observations far from the temporal threshold. This common empirical practice is hard to square with the assumptions of a cross-sectional RD, which is conceptualized for an estimation bandwidth shrinking even as the sample size increases. Second, estimates may be biased if the time-series properties of the data are ignored (for instance, in the presence of an autoregressive process), or more generally if short-run and long-run effects differ. Finally, tests for sorting or bunching near the threshold are often irrelevant, making the framework closer to an event study than a regression discontinuity design. Based on these features and motivated by hypothetical examples using air quality data, we offer suggestions for the empirical researcher wishing to use the RD in time framework.},

  abstract = {We investigate the market value of rarity theoretically and empirically. Prior studies find that the market value of rarity follows a power law, but this finding lacks a theoretical foundation. We provide a micro-foundation for this finding, demonstrating that the observed power law emerges in a competitive market where agents have rank-dependent utility preferences. The model leads to two new theoretical insights: (i) the rank of an item within a set of close substitutes and the quantity of that item known to exist are both natural measures of rarity, but rank is predicted to perform better; (ii) there is a systematic relationship between the estimated slope and intercept from a regression of log price on log rank. When we test the model on data from over 4000 auction records of rare baseball cards, we find that a regression with only log rank and grading company explains 60% of the variation in log price.},

We estimate this model with an illustrative sample of card prices for several different years. The results are used to demonstrate the construction of price indices (i.e. rates-of-return) for baseball cards for this particular set of cards using two methods. Finally, we extract specific values that individual player characteristics contribute to the value of a card.},
