# Liquidity Shocks in Virtual Skin Markets

This is a personal writing sample by Caleb Bray to examine the effect of Valve's implementation of a 7-day trade ban on items in Counter-Strike.

## Description

This paper serves as a case study to examine the effects of sudden market structure changes in virtual asset markets. The virtual market I examine behaves similarly to ``Over the Counter'' asset markets where liquidity shocks have a meaningful effect on asset price and choice. Using a difference-in-differences approach, I find that implementation of a 7-day trade ban on all cosmetic items in the video game Counter-Strike reduces quality adjusted prices by 4.2\% and trading volume by 15703.3 trades suggesting the creation of an illiquidity discount. This effect persists for at least two years after treatment.

Note: Weighted averages and standard deviations for table 1 are calculated using volume sold as weights and using wtd.mean and the square root of wtd.var from R's Hmisc package.
